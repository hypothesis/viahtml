Via HTML
========

A proxy that serves up third party HTML pages with the
[Hypothesis client](https://github.com/hypothesis/client) embedded, so you can
annotate them.

Installing Via HTML in a development environment
------------------------------------------------

### You will need

* Via HTML integrates with h and the Hypothesis client, so you will need to
  set up development environments for each of those before you can develop Via:

  * https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/install/
  * https://h.readthedocs.io/projects/client/en/latest/developers/developing/

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
  Follow the instructions in the pyenv README to install it.
  The Homebrew method works best on macOS.

### Clone the git repo

    git clone https://github.com/hypothesis/viahtml.git

This will download the code into a `viahtml` directory in your current working
directory. You need to be in the `viahtml` directory from the remainder of the
installation process:

    cd viahtml

### Start the development server

    make dev

The first time you run `make dev` it might take a while to start because it'll
need to install the application dependencies and build the assets.

This will start NGINX running on http://localhost:9085 and reverse proxying to
UWSGI running the app. If you make changes to the app, you will need to restart
it.

**That's it!** Youâ€™ve finished setting up your Via HTML development environment. 
Run `make help` to see all the commands that are available for running the tests,
linting, code formatting, etc.

Architecture
------------

Via HTML is composed of three compoments:

 * NGINX running on port 9085
 * UWSGI running a `pywb` based application
 * A docker container running `supervisor` to run the other two parts
 
The UWSGI app runs using a binary protocol, which means you can't directly
contact it using a browser.

Static content is served directly from NGINX after being built using 
`make build`. This should happen for you automatically on first run. But if
you change the content you may want to re-run it.
